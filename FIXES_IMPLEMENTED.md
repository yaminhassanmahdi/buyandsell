# REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX - FINAL PUSH

## Critical Issues Found and Solutions Needed:

### 1. ❌ Browse Page Filters Not Showing Attributes
**Issue**: In browse pages (e.g., `/browse?categoryId=books`), the attribute filters are not showing even though the category has attributes.

**Root Cause**: In `src/app/browse/page.tsx` line 55, the code is using `at.category_id` instead of `at.categoryId`.

**Fix Needed**:
```javascript
// Change this line:
return attributeTypes.filter(at => at.category_id === categoryId);
// To this:
return attributeTypes.filter(at => at.categoryId === categoryId);
```

### 2. ❌ Mobile Listing Shows Only 1 Product Per Row
**Issue**: Throughout the site, mobile listings show 1 product per row instead of 2.

**Locations to Fix**:
- `src/app/browse/page.tsx` - Change `grid-cols-1` to `grid-cols-2`
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Update home page grids
- `src/app/category/[categoryId]/page.tsx` - Fix category page grids
- `src/app/account/my-products/page.tsx` - Make seller products 2 per row

**Fix Pattern**:
```javascript
// Change from:
"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4"
// To:
"grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4"
```

### 3. ❌ Product Detail Page Still Using Card Layout
**Issue**: Product page is still wrapped in a Card component instead of being a natural page layout.

**Fix Needed**: Remove Card wrapper and create full-page layout with:
- No card wrapper
- Price below description (not above)
- Natural e-commerce layout

### 4. ❌ Header Search Box Needs Icon-Only Mode
**Issue**: Search box takes too much space in header, needs to be icon-only that expands on click.

**Fix Needed**: 
- Update `src/components/search-box.tsx` with compact mode
- Update `src/components/site-header.tsx` to use wide logo and compact search

### 5. ❌ Remove Gap Between Product Name and Price
**Issue**: Unnecessary gap in product cards between name and price.

**Fix Needed**: Update `src/components/product-card.tsx` spacing.

### 6. ❌ Order List Items Show Addresses
**Issue**: Seller profile orders show full addresses, should only show essential info.

**Fix Needed**: Update `src/components/order-list-item.tsx` to remove address display.

### 7. ❌ My Orders/Sales Need Product Images and Better Info
**Issue**: Order pages should show product images, names, prices, quantities clearly.

**Fix Needed**: Enhance order display components.

### 8. ❌ Product Upload Should Support Multiple Images
**Issue**: Currently only supports single image, needs multiple image upload.

**Fix Needed**: Update product upload form and detail page for image gallery.

## Implementation Priority:
1. Fix attribute filtering (critical for functionality)
2. Fix mobile 2-per-row layout (critical for UX)
3. Remove product page card layout
4. Update header search to icon-only
5. Fix gaps and spacing issues
6. Enhance order displays
7. Add multiple image support

## Files That Need Changes:
- `src/app/browse/page.tsx` (attribute filtering + mobile grid)
- `src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx` (remove card layout)
- `src/components/search-box.tsx` (compact mode)
- `src/components/site-header.tsx` (wide logo + compact search)
- `src/components/product-card.tsx` (remove gaps)
- `src/components/order-list-item.tsx` (remove addresses)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (mobile grid)
- `src/app/category/[categoryId]/page.tsx` (mobile grid)
- `src/app/account/my-products/page.tsx` (mobile grid)

Each of these issues is preventing the site from being ready for live deployment.
